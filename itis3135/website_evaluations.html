            <h3><a href='https://www.espn.com/'>ESPN</a></h3>
            <p class="left">
                The ESPN site has a lot of infomation displayed with diffent menu options.
                The site's colors consists of mostly grey, white, black, and red. There is also a lot of information 
                that is being displayed on the landing page.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast: </b>The ESPN site has a lot of contranst, but with some information like 
                scores the light gray against the white is hard to see.</li>
                <li><b>Repetition: </b>The ESPN site has a lot of repetition in the way it displays its information, 
                such as, the way the games are lined up in a row with their logo, acronym, and score repeated throughout.</li>
                <li><b>Alignment: </b>Everything on the ESPN site seems the have good alignment. I don't see any inconsistencies 
                in the straight lines they have created with their design.</li>
                <li><b>Proximity: </b>This is where ESPN fails hard. Their site is too cluttered because they have so much information 
                being displayed at once. When clicking on the menu items you are bombarded with more clutter and it is very distacting.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><a href='https://www.charlotte.edu/'>UNC Charlotte</a></h3>
            <p class="left">
                The UNC CHarlotte home page is a very well designed web page that displays its college 
                colors while providing different hyperlinks to other important web pages. Additionally, when scrolling down the page you 
                are met with a lot of different statistics and information about the college.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Contrast: </b>The UNC charlotte webpage utilizes their school colors of green, white, and gold to create lots of contrast.
                This makes the text pop against images and the background which provides an easy viewing experience.</li>
                <li><b>Repetition: </b>Repetition is used on the page to display links and different options that a visitor may find useful.
                 even as we scroll down the page we have a repetition of background to image that allows us to fully grasph the ideas that the university 
                wants to sell.</li>
                <li><b>Alignment: </b>Everything on the UNC Charlotte's website is very well aligned which allows for an ease of access to information. 
                When the designers grouped things together they created different way to display it, but nothing is competiting with against each other.</li>
                <li><b>Proximity: </b>Unlike the ESPN site, I think the UNC Charlotte's website is very well spaced out if not a bit too spaced out. The proximity of
                 different items allows for these picture backgrounds that add a layer onto the website. Which in my opinion is very easy on the eyes and not overwhelming.</li>
